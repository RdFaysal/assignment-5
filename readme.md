## 1. answer:
 getElementById, getElementsByClassName, querySelector, and querySelectorAll are used to select DOM elements, where getElementById selects by ID, getElementsByClassName returns a live HTMLCollection, and querySelector / querySelectorAll use CSS selectors to return the first or all matching elements respectively.

## 2. answer:
To create and insert a new element into the DOM, use document.createElement(), set its content, and then insert it using methods like append(), prepend(), before(), or after().

## 3. answer:
Event Bubbling is when an event first triggers on the target element and then propagates upward through its parent elements.

## 4. answer:
Event Delegation means attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events on its child elements, which improves performance and works well for dynamic content.

## 5. answer:
preventDefault() stops the elementâ€™s default browser behavior, while stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up to parent elements.
